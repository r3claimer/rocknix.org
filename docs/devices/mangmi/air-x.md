## Installation

### Step 1: Image SD card

First download the `SM6115` version of ROCKNIX from the [Latest Nightly Build](https://github.com/ROCKNIX/distribution-nightly/releases/latest) and follow the instructions listed on the [Install](../../../play/install/) page.

<!-- [![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/ROCKNIX/distribution.svg?labelColor=111111&color=FF5555&label=Latest&style=flat#only-light)](https://github.com/ROCKNIX/distribution-nightly/releases/latest)

### Step 2: Install ROCKNIX Android Bootloader (ABL)

- Once you have written the image to an SD card, insert the card and boot into Android.
- In Android, copy the folder `rocknix_abl` from the SD card to the root of the Internal Storage.
- Navigate to Settings -> Handheld Settings -> Advanced -> Run Script as Root.
- Select the `rocknix_abl` folder on the Internal Storage.
- Run the `backup_abl.sh` script to backup the currently installed ABL.
- Run the `flash_abl.sh` script to flash the ROCKNIX ABL.

!!! note "If GammaOS is installed rather than stock Android, run the `backup_abl.sh` and `flash_abl.sh` scripts in an Android Debug Bridge (adb) shell."

### Step 3: Configure ROCKNIX ABL

- Restart your device, holding Vol- as it boots to enter the ROCKNIX ABL. Within the ROCKNIX ABL, use Vol- / Vol+ to navigate between options and Power to select.
- Navigate to 'Set device model' and select MQ65 / MQ66 as appropriate.
- Navigate to 'Switch boot mode' and switch it to 'Linux'.
- Navigate to 'Start' to boot into ROCKNIX.
