## Dual Screen
These commands will configure the Dual Screen, you will need to login to your device using SSH to run them.

You will need to toggle the "Enable SSH" option by pressing ++"START"++ and going to ```Network Settings```. Also make sure that "Enable Wifi" is also toggled and your device is connected to your network. The IP address of your device can be found at the top of the ```Network Settings``` menu

To configure screen orientation and resolution
```bash
swaymsg output DP-1 transform 270
swaymsg output DP-1 bg #000000 solid_color
swaymsg output DP-1 allow_tearing yes
swaymsg output DP-1 max_render_time off
swaymsg output DP-1 scale 2
swaymsg output DP-1 position 0 0
systemctl restart essway.service
```

To mirror the dual screen on the main screen, run these commands in addition to the ones above
```bash
swaymsg output DSI-1 scale 2
swaymsg output DSI-1 position 0 0
systemctl restart essway.service
```

For the touch screen
```bash
swaymsg input "8746:1:RetroidPocket_RDS_Touchscreen" map_to_output "DP-1"
swaymsg input "8746:1:RetroidPocket_RDS_Touchscreen" calibration_matrix "0 1 0 -1 0 1"
```

However, this configuration is only temporary, as the settings will revert if the device is shutdown or restarted. 
Additonally, these commands can be placed into a script and ran from the file manager to bypass the need to ssh.
